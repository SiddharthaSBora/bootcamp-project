## Comments
    - Some preliminary evidence of dependence between observable characteristics and rank, indicative of other companies bidding differently for ad placement based on observable (or unobservable) characteristics
    
    
## Questions
    1 Categorizing different groups of people based on outcome combinations (click/buy, click/nobuy, noclick/nobuy) 
    2 What is the way to cluster different groups? By rank? Or by click-buy, click-nobuy (click:rank1-nobuy and click:rank2-5-nobuy), noclick-nobuy?
    3 find out the important groups and increase or decrease ad expense on these groups. importance is defined as click rate within each rank? (is it what you mean in the meeting?
    4 Can we just focus on groups (no click, no buy; click (rank 2-5), no buy)? As for groups who click and buy, we could just ignore them. For group who click on high rank (no.1) ad but don't buy, no need to waste money. My original thought is that we could just exclude these samples from our dataset and focus on the rest of groups. But that means we do the analysis for click and buy together.  
    5 quesion 1-4 are all categorizing question, so I make a little summary
       - categorize groups, three ways 
          - click-buy,click-nobuy,noclick-nobuy
          - click-buy,click:rank1-nobuy,click:rank2-5-nobuy, noclick-nobuy
          - by rank, rank 1, rank 2, rank 3, rank 4, rank 5
          - more? 
    6 Can we change bids by dollar values for different groupings of people to reallocate advertising budget more efficiently? assume you have 100 dollars, how to assign these amount of money to dif groups efficiently? then go back to the original question, the criteria for identification of important groups?
    7 Should we focus on click rates versus buy rates, given our lack of information or control of policy terms?
      - if the answer is yes, then we could just ignore the first two categorizing proposals? 
    
       
## Descriptive Statistics
    - Click rates by ranks; propensity of click among different rank groups 
    - By rank and click --> summary statistics, distributions of observables
    - Identifying Groups:
        * Independent of rank --> click rates by observable characteristics (e.g. decision trees). Consistent groupings across different ranks
        * Conditional on rank --> groups of people within ranks (decision trees for click rates within ranks). Inconsistent groupings across ranks. 
        * Independent of click rates --> Identify different groups of customers without noting click rates; examine each groups click rate responsiveness to rank


## Analysis part 
    - decision tree within each rank (only focus on the click variable, so the outcome would be a classification tree for click for each rank)
    - CTR ? to see if we could use their approach

## next time for meeting 
    - Monday, 11:00 am 
    
    
##### Follow up notes
    - 24 unique combinations of observable characteristics; not all unique combinations observed for all ranks.
    - Group sizes range from ~600 to ~200
