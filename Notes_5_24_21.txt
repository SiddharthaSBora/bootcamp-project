### Meeting Notes
    * Price per group-sale (e.g. price per click x clicks per sale)

### Schedule
    * Categorizing and analyzing the problem; Descriptivate statistics
        - Click and sale probabilities across rank, groups
        - Categorizing policies sold --> costs per policies sold across different groups
    * Defending focus on policies_sold
        - Within rank, only significant predictor from tree approach --> number of drivers
        - Q: How to incorporate that into our model?
    * Model specificiation and selection
        - Logistic Regression (policies_sold)
        - Multinomial Logit (Nested Logit) (policies_sold = 1/click = 1, policies_sold = 0/click = 1, click = 0)
        - Decision Tree/Random Forest (policies_sold)
    * Predicting sale probabilities and Identifying "movable" groups
