# Root Insurance - Erdos Data Bootcamp Project


## Background
- “Impressions” of ads are shown to potential customers in vertical search websites.
- Ads are shown in these websites in order of the insurance companies’ bids on these ads.
- Insurance companies pay the bid amount only if their ad is clicked.
- ACME’s current bidding strategy does not differentiate based on customer characteristics,  i.e. $10 for all ads.
- Is there an alternative bidding strategy which may help ACME optimize its marketing spend?

## Objective
- Suggest an optimal bid strategy for Root Insurance Company in the Vertical Search channel.

## Method
- Descriptive analysis
- Decision tree
- Logit regression
